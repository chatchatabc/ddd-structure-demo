Template DDD project structure with jMolecules
==============================================

A project shows standard structure of Domain Driven Design project with Spring Boot.

# Domain Driven Design Architecture

![Domain Driven Design](src/site/images/ddd-landscape.png)

# Domain Driven Design Layers - Onion Architecture

![Onion Architecture](src/site/images/onion-architecture.png)

# Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture with DDD

![Hexagonal Architecture with DDD](src/site/images/hexagon-ddd.png)

![Hexagon with Application and Infrastructure](src/site/images/hexagon-application-infra.png

Please consider to adopt Hexagonal Architecture for DDD application layer, example packages as following:

* web package: Web application with templates
* rest package: HTTP REST API
* graphql package: GraphQL API
* grpc package: gRPC API
* rsocket package: RSocket API
* facade package: Facade API for other domains
* common package: Common API for other ports

# CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Separation) Pattern - Write and Read Separation

![CQRS Pattern](src/site/images/cqrs-pattern.png)

Please consider to adopt CQRS Pattern for DDD Repository design.

# Reactive DDD - communication between bounded contexts

![Reactive DDD](src/site/images/reactive-ddd.png)

* Async vs Sync
* Message Driven & Back Pressure
* Reactive(RSocket) protocols: Request/Response, Request/Stream, Fire & Forget, Channel
* Reactive Stream Frameworks: Reactor(Mono,Flux), RxJava, Akka Streams, Smallrye Mutiny, Kotlin Flow
* RSocket prefer

# DDD with CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture, Reactive

* DDD Repository: CQRS
* DDD Application and Infrastructure Layers: Hexagonal Architecture
* DDD Event/Communication: Reactive
* DDD Factory: Design Pattern

# Features

* Project directory/package structure
* Validation with specification
* Exception with error package: Spring 6 ProblemDetail integration
* Annotations with jMolecules
* DDD application layer with Hexagonal architecture
* Event firing/listener with Spring Events
* ArchUnit integrated

# Requirements

* Java 17
* Apache Maven 3.5+

# Tips

* DTO(Data Transfer Object): please use record instead of class - https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/java-records
* Please consider Observability into your architecture: Logging, Metrics, Tracing, Events.
